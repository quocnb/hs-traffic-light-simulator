language: English
summary: "<div><div class=\"alert alert-primary\">You will practice concepts frequently\
  \ tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.</div>\r\n<p>Do you know\
  \ how traffic lights were invented? Some time ago, it was decided to replace the\
  \ traffic police officers with a looped automated system that gives information\
  \ to drivers about whether they can continue driving or not. In this project, we\
  \ will implement a simplified version of such a system for a road junction in which\
  \ many roads converge to one.</p></div><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/288?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
